Extend the CI pipeline to include continuous delivery using Jenkins or
GitLab CI. Implement a blue-green deployment strategy?

To extend your CI pipeline for continuous delivery (CD) with a blue-green deployment strategy using Jenkins or GitLab CI, youâ€™ll need to:

Set up your CI pipeline so that after a successful build and test, it triggers a deployment job.
Automate blue-green deployments so that you have two environments ("blue" and "green") and switch traffic between them.
Below are templates and explanations for both Jenkins and GitLab CI/CD.
Choose the one that fits your stack or let me know if you need both in detail!

Jenkins Pipeline Example (Declarative Pipeline)

Jenkinsfile
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
Explanation:

get-active-env.sh: Detects which environment is live.
deploy.sh <env>: Deploys the new version to the inactive environment.
switch-traffic.sh <env>: Switches traffic (DNS, load balancer, etc.) to the new environment.
cleanup.sh <env>: Optionally tears down or cleans up the previous environment.
GitLab CI/CD Example

.gitlab-ci.yml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy
  - switch
  - cleanup
Blue-Green Deployment Script Suggestions
get-active-env.sh: Queries your load balancer, DNS, or a config file to determine which environment is live.
deploy.sh <env>: Deploys to the specified environment.
switch-traffic.sh <env>: Updates your load balancer or DNS to route traffic to the target environment.
cleanup.sh <env>: Optional, to delete or shut down the previous environment.
Next Steps
Decide if you want to use Jenkins or GitLab CI (or both).
Ensure your infrastructure (Kubernetes, VMs, etc.) can support two parallel environments.
Implement the helper scripts (get-active-env.sh, deploy.sh, switch-traffic.sh, cleanup.sh) for your application and infrastructure.
